# fontbrowser

View and organize fonts on your desktop. Windows, Mac, and Linux. Open source and free forever, no restrictions. Finds all installed system fonts automatically, with the option to add your own font folders. View all glyphs for any font on demand. Option to view fonts with ANY OpenType features implemented by any font you have installed toggled on. Will that do anything? That's for you to find out! Tags not yet implemented but coming soon.

# disclaimer

Started this from scratch two weeks ago (as of late March 2023) and am learning electron, react, and typescript as I go. In theory releases should all be runnable on all 3 platforms but I mostly have only been testing on Windows. You won't mess up your computer by running this thing but it also might not work! ymmv, peace out folks.

# note on origins

This program was created in dialogue with members of the [renegade bindery](https://renegadepublishing.carrd.co/) discord server, and as such is presented in the spirit of the [fannish gift economy](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Gift_Economy). 

# known issues

The zoom in keyboard shortcut listed in the "View" menu doesn't work unless you also press the shift key. This is apparently a known electron issue that they have never fixed for some reason. I'm looking in to a workaround.

On page load the font samples display without styles for a second before properly rendering.
